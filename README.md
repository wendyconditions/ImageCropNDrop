# ImageCropNDrop

## Allows contributers to simply drag and drop content from their machine. 
## Created by myself and another developer using angular directives and a cropping service hosted on github. Image upload gets sent to Amazon S3 and returns a url that is then stored in the database for future use (pathways or user profile).

### Note: CSS, HTML, and Angular directives, service, and controller are placed in the HTML file for ease of viewing (I hope).

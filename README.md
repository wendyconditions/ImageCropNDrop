# ImageCropNDrop

## Allows contributers to drag and drop content from their machine. 
## Created by myself and another developer using angular directives and a cropping service hosted on github. Image upload gets sent to Amazon S3 and returns a url that is then stored in the database for future use (pathways or user profile).

## Although I worked with another developer on this (functionality and S3), I designed the UI.
